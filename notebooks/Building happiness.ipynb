    "### Things learned with First implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Use `pull_session` with no session_id to have bokeh generate one for you\n",
    "The following code asks bokeh server to generate a session for the plot script that's in `individual.py` and generate a unique session.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "bokeh_session = pull_session(session_id=None, url='http://localhost:5006/individual/')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Where bokeh plots are served from is limited\n",
    "\n",
    "To make my plots available I launched bokeh server with `bokeh serve viz/individual.py viz/individuals.py` this resulted in plots being available at http://localhost:5006/individual/ and http://localhost:5006/individuals/.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no way to change those urls, they are based on the file name, although you can add a prefix with the `--prefix` option passed to `bokeh serve`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, if you use the bokeh app folder structure http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.11.0/docs/user_guide/server.html#directory-format then you can only have one plot in each directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### You need to program defensively\n",
    "While something like django's template engine is very forgiving, bokeh server isn't. User's aren't going to get any helpful message if the plot fails to load, and django isn't going to know that the plot is going to fail to load. As a result it's important to make sure all inputs are available for bokeh and appropriate fallbacks are available.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### `autoload_server` has a lot of options\n",
    "There are a number of examples of using autoload_server in the bokeh examples, but there are actually a lot of different ways to use it and it's worth checking out the docs http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.11.0/docs/reference/embed.html#bokeh.embed.autoload_server\n",
    "\n",
    "###### There's no way (yet) to pass a bokeh session a variable\n",
    "In this implementation I had to setup a ColumnDataSource called `user_pk_source` to pass the user_id (or `object.pk`) to bokeh. The ColumnDataSource is always a dictionary of lists. This meant passing the user_id in the form\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "{\n",
    "    'user_pk': [user_id]\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The code that did this is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "user_source = bokeh_session.document.get_model_by_name('user_pk_source')\n",
    "user_source.data = dict(user_pk=[self.object.pk])\n",
    "```\n",
    "This was pretty clunky, what would have been nice would be some kind of custom session attribute so we could do\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Warning - does not currently work\n",
    "bokeh_session.user_pk = self.object.pk\n",
    "```\n",
    "There is an open issue https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/issues/3349 to add this feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that the method `document.get_model_by_name` was useful in making this relatively concise and transparent. For this to work though you must add the source to the document so that django can access it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "document.add_root(plot)\n",
    "document.add_root(user_pk_source)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The order that you add things to the Document is (was) important\n",
    "\n",
    "As noted above, I needed to add the `user_pk_source` to the `Document` so that I could access it with the `document.get_model_by_name` method. However, it turned out to be very important which order that you add things to the Document. The `plot` had to be added first in order to ensure that the plot rendered correctly. There is an open pull request fixing this constraint: https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh/pull/3624\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Bokeh accessing Django ORM\n",
    "To allow bokeh to use the Django ORM, I needed to start the bokeh server with the django settings available. The bokeh server was started with the command\n",
    "\n",
    "`PYTHONPATH=$PWD DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=webapp.settings bokeh serve viz/individual.py viz/individuals.py viz/team.py viz/teams.py --log-level=info --host=localhost:5006 --host=localhost:8001`\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, I needed bokeh to make a call to django.setup() once. In each plot declaration I had the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from viz.utils import django_setup\n",
    "if not django_setup:\n",
    "    import django\n",
    "    django.setup()\n",
    "    django_setup = True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Use --host argument to give django access to bokeh\n",
    "The following command was use to start bokeh server. In it we give the django server (which is running on port 8001) the ability to access bokeh server as well as giving the bokeh server permission to access itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "`PYTHONPATH=$PWD DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=webapp.settings bokeh serve viz/individual.py viz/individuals.py viz/team.py viz/teams.py --log-level=info --host=localhost:5006 --host=localhost:8001`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Add a timeout callback to initially render the plot\n",
    "The periodic callback in bokeh was set to 5 seconds so that the database wasn't being hit too often. To setup the periodic callback I did\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "document.add_periodic_callback(update_data, 5000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, this delayed loading of the initial plot. To compensate for this I added the following \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def update_data_once():\n",
    "    update_data()\n",
    "\n",
    "document.add_timeout_callback(update_data_once, 250)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "[`add_timeout_callback`](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.11.0/docs/reference/document.html#bokeh.document.Document.add_timeout_callback) adds a callback to be invoked once, after a given amount of time - 250ms in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I wanted to do was just:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Warning - does not currently work\n",
    "document.add_timeout_callback(update_data, 250)\n",
    "document.add_periodic_callback(update_data, 5000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately this doesn't work at the moment and bokeh kicks up an error because we've tried to add the same callback method twice. As a result I needed to add the dummy method `update_data_once`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Legends only render once in bokeh\n",
    "In this demo, plots have legends, that change based on the user's data. It turns out that the legend layout calculation is done only once. This means that if you're not careful, you can end up with your legend being laid out poorly with text overlapping the legend glyph. The main change I made which seemed to prevent this giving a modest delay to `add_timeout_callback`. I didn't dig into this a lot, just got something working."

My data was being updated on every periodic callback (every 5 seconds). This wastes bandwidth and I'm not sure what it would have done to performance on a slow connection. \n",

    "\n",
    "If a not-logged in user tried to hit my bokeh server directly they would only be served with a blank plot which is probably fine, but using these options would have improved security further.

As you say, if the sessions are empty anyway until your Django app fills them in, it's harmless (other than resource usage) for people to connect, so you wouldn't have to use external-signed mode. But say for example your sessions did have some type of proprietary information (perhaps not per-user info, just info that should only be accessible to someone who's logged in or someone who's a member of a certain group), and that info was in the session by default - then you might want external-signed so that Django could control access to the bokeh server.\n",

    "### Problems with this implementation and what I subsequently learned\n",
    "\n",
    "##### The problem - hitting the database unecessarily\n",
    "The big problem that I saw with this implementation was that it was that every session was hitting the database every 5 seconds. Although this was fine at small scale it seemed like a waste of resources and unlikely to scale well. In addition, knowing that django has on_save hooks - meaning I could take an action when data was updated - I wanted to do better.\n",
    "\n",
    "After talking with some people I learned some more fundamentals about how bokeh server works and that there are better ways of setting this particular example up.  \n",
    "\n",
    "##### What I learned\n",
    "\n",
    "I had been thinking of a `Session` as an instance of a `Document`. It's not. A `Session` is just a container that can hold a `Document`. It can hold any `Document` and you don't have to declare that `Document` in the bokeh app code! This may be obvious to some, but was a bit of a revelation to me. I had only seen examples that used the `Document` or `curdoc` and then served up that file with `bokeh serve` and I hadn't connected all the dots.\n",
    "\n",
    "What connected the dots was Havoc highlighting difference between [`pull_session`](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.11.0/docs/reference/client.html#bokeh.client.session.pull_session) and [`push_session`](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/0.11.0/docs/reference/client.html#bokeh.client.session.push_session). Both create a session. But `pull_session` gives you the state from the bokeh server and in `push_session` you give the state to bokeh server. The state is an instance of `Document`. The key is then deciding which side is authoritative. If bokeh server is authoritative then you would want to use `pull_session` to get the session from bokeh and then modify it how you need to. On the other hand, if django is authoritative then using `push_session` you can just build the `Document` in django with the data from django and push it to the server. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main problem I wanted to fix was to only have data updated when there was new data. From a django perspective, this means bokeh only updating when a save event occurs which can be done with the [`post_save` signal](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/signals/#django.db.models.signals.post_save). So the idea is:\n",
    "* instead of bokeh checking the database every 5 seconds\n",
    "* have django update the all the bokeh sessions' data in a `post_save` signal\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of ways of doing this, in my second implementation I am going for the most simple, but there are other ways - and these are discussed at the end of this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: \"First implementation\" could still be a good set-up\n",
    "Although I then re-wrote the example, it's worth noting that I can imagine scenarios where I would still use a setup like this. With the bokeh server still new, we don't yet have enough real world experience of what works well and not for scalable web-facing (not on a private network) applications.

    "## Second Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it works\n",
    "In my second implementation, bokeh-server will be very naive and django will do all the work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Django will push all the data to bokeh sessions and when there is new data django will push it to bokeh server. Bokeh server will then just focus on its job of updating the attached clients and pushing that new data down to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cleans up a number of things, but does mean that in django I will need to keep track of bokeh sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given that django already has [sessions](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/sessions/), I can just add the bokeh session ids to the user's session and they'll be readily available for me to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Two options for updating a bokeh session. \n",
    "It's worth noting that there are two options for updating a bokeh session and which one you pick depends on your use case. You can either store the session_id or keep the Session object. If you keep the Session object, you'll be keeping the sessions open between django and bokeh. This has the advantage that you don't need to download the document again when you want to update the data, but the disadvantage that you'll be keeping all the sessions open. If you just store the session_id then you'll need to use `pull_session` to download the Document from bokeh server and then update the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given in the happiness I don't expect data updates to be too frequent, I'm going with the second option of storing the session_id and not keeping the session open. I'm not sure this is the correct choice - please do share your experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### What this cleans up\n",
    "In doing it this way, my bokeh server is a completely empty implementation. There is no need for the four instances of `individual`, `individuals`, `team`, `teams`. All the bokeh code will live under my django `views` and django will push the plots to bokeh. This should make everything cleaner and easier to follow what's going on as the code isn't in two places (under bokeh or django). It also means that I don't need to restart the bokeh server any time I want to make a change to a bokeh plot."
